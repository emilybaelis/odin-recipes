<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>2 Tablespoons unsweetened, cocoa powder</li>
    <li>2 cups sugar</li>
    <li>1 cup vegetable oil or canola</li>
    <li>2 eggs</li>
    <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1-2 oz. red food coloring</li>
    <li>1/2 cup plain hot coffee</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon white distilled vinegar</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 325 F.</li>
    <li>Generously grease and flour (2) 9-inch round cake pans. Set aside.</li>
    <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, baking powder, cocoa powder, and salt. Set aside.</li>
    <li>In a large bowl, combine the sugar and vegetable oil.</li>
    <li>Mix in the eggs, buttermilk, vanilla, and red food coloring until combined.</li>
    <li>Stir in the coffee and white vinegar.</li>
    <li>Combine the wet ingredients with the dry ingredients a little at a time, mixing after each addition, just until combined. (Batter will be thin)</li>
    <li>Pour the batter evenly into each pan.</li>
    <li>Bake in the middle rack for 30-40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with moist crumbs clinging to it.
        Do not overbake as the cake will continue to cook as it cools.</li>
    <li>Let pans cool on a cooling rack until the pans are warm to the touch.</li>
    <li>Slide a knife or offset spatula around the inside of the pans to loosen the cake from the pan.</li>
    <li>Gently remove the cakes from the pan and let them finish cooling. (The warm cake will be very delicate)</li>
    <li>Frost the cake with cream cheese frosting when the cakes have cooled completely.</li>
